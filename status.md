## ✅ Latest Confirmed Outcomes (2026-04-22)

1. Dashboard update behavior changed to event-driven only:
   - `watcher_manager` no longer writes `Dashboard.md` on every poll loop iteration.
   - Dashboard updates only when files are actually processed (moved between folders) or a watcher is restarted.
   - Gmail/LinkedIn watchers now immediately update dashboard after detecting new items (`_notify_dashboard` in `base_watcher.py`).
2. Dashboard Recent Activity deduplication applied:
   - All intake events (`Needs_Action`, `Inbox`, `Approved`, `MCP`, `Email auto-processing`) now track last-reported counts in orchestrator instance state.
   - Dashboard entry is only written when a count actually changes (e.g., 31→32), not on every identical poll cycle.
3. Recent Activity capped at 25 entries, newest on top:
   - `_add_activity` in `update_dashboard.py` prepends new entries and trims list to 25.
4. LinkedIn content calendar default posting time changed from 9 AM to 12 PM:
   - `optimal_times` list in `create_content_plan.py` updated; all future generated calendars start at 12 PM.
   - All existing calendar entries in W15, W16, W17 (JSON + MD files) backfilled to `T12:00:00`.
   - `Dashboard.md` content schedule reference also updated.

## ✅ Previously Confirmed Outcomes (2026-04-21)

1. Confirmed startup preflight gate correctly blocks runtime when Gmail MCP auth-refresh fails:
   - Failure observed in watcher manager logs: `❌ STARTUP PREFLIGHT FAILED: Gmail MCP authentication check failed`
   - Root error during preflight/profile check: `request to https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token failed, reason:`
   - Startup aborted as intended (watchers stopped).
2. Confirmed this incident was not orchestrator business-logic specific:
   - Direct Gmail MCP profile check failed during incident window with same OAuth token-endpoint error.
   - Network diagnostics later showed DNS resolution + HTTPS reachability healthy.
3. Confirmed recovery without code changes:
   - Direct Gmail MCP profile check succeeded after transient window.
   - Fresh startup preflight then passed at `2026-04-20 12:26:05`: `✅ Startup preflight passed: Gmail MCP authentication healthy`.
4. Previously delivered Silver hardening still in place:
   - Approved-folder execution path works without restart.
   - Direct approved-email skill execution path queues actions correctly.
   - Orchestrator loop remains integrated in watcher manager runtime.
   - Low-priority/newsletter auto-processing remains active.
   - MCP failure-text classification remains strict in `mcp_processor`.
5. Fixed email routing behavior for post-intake processing:
   - Auto-processed emails are removed from `Needs_Action` and archived to `Done`.
   - Emails with `requires_approval: true` are routed to `Pending_Approval` (no longer left in `Needs_Action`).
   - `Needs_Action` now acts as active queue, not long-term storage.
6. Added dashboard event-level visibility from orchestrator loop:
   - Logs/dashboard activity now include `Needs_Action` intake, `Inbox` intake, `Approved` intake, MCP execution results, and email auto-processing outcome counts.
   - Auto-processing log now reports explicit counters: `processed`, `kept_for_review`, `moved_to_pending_approval`.
   - Dashboard pending counts remain auto-refreshed from `Needs_Action` + `Pending_Approval`.
7. Verified no filename-duplicate email markdown artifacts across `Needs_Action` and `Done` in current vault snapshot.
   - Check result: `DUPLICATE_EMAIL_COUNT=0` for `EMAIL_*.md` base-name comparison.
8. Startup duplication behavior clarified and hardened:
   - Repeated preflight log lines were from repeated start/shutdown cycles and in-flight preflight finishing after shutdown signal, not concurrent active duplicate managers.
   - Added single-instance guard in `start.sh` to block duplicate watcher-manager launches.
9. Claude subprocess lifecycle hardened for timeout cleanup:
   - Replaced blocking `subprocess.run(... timeout=...)` paths with `Popen + communicate(timeout)` for Claude invocations in orchestrator + MCP processor.
   - On timeout, process group now gets `SIGTERM` then `SIGKILL` fallback, reducing orphan/background memory usage.
10. Approved-email action/reporting fixes applied:
   - `process_email_actions` now parses "Draft a reply" separately, skips reply/draft with explicit reason when reply body missing, and treats unchecked forward-target as skipped instead of unknown.
   - Done-file execution summary now renders markdown "Actions Taken" (human-readable) instead of raw JSON blob.
11. Gmail label-update MCP instruction normalized:
   - MCP prompt now maps to Gmail label tool semantics (`messageId`, `removeLabels`, `addLabels`) to reduce modify-label parameter mismatch.
   - Remaining "Requested entity was not found" failures still possible when message ID is stale/inaccessible in connected mailbox context.

## 🏗️ Key Architectural Decisions

### AD-001: MCP-first external email actions (2026-04-02)
**Decision:** Email actions are executed through MCP action files instead of direct API calls from skills.

**Why:** Silver requirement compliance, clearer separation of concerns, improved auditability.

**Impact:**
- Skills create MCP action files in `Needs_Action/`
- MCP processor executes actions and archives results
- External action trail is explicit and reviewable

### AD-002: Dedicated MCP processor (2026-04-02)
**Decision:** Keep MCP execution in `src/orchestrator/mcp_processor.py` and invoke via orchestrator loop.

**Why:** Isolation of integration logic, easier testing, extensible for additional MCP servers.

**Impact:** Complete end-to-end MCP workflow now functional.

### AD-003: LinkedIn API-first integration (2026-04-10 → 2026-04-11 validation)
**Decision:** Use official LinkedIn API + OAuth, not browser automation.

**Why:** Reliability, maintainability, security, production suitability.

**Impact:**
- OAuth token storage at `credentials/linkedin_api_token.json`
- Posting validated with live share
- Message monitoring removed from standard flow (Partner Program required)

---

## 🔧 Current Operational Capabilities

### Email
- Monitor unread Gmail messages
- Create actionable files for orchestrator
- Process actions: mark as read, archive, reply, delete
- Send email through skill flow with HITL guardrails

### LinkedIn
- OAuth authentication via setup script
- Text/link/image posting via official API
- Content-calendar based post workflow
- Approval-gated publishing through vault folders

### System Management
- Multi-watcher lifecycle management (watcher_manager for filesystem + Gmail + LinkedIn)
- Restart limits + stale lock cleanup
- Logging and dashboard update support
- Legacy dashboard static watcher lines auto-cleaned; live status shown in `## Watcher Status`
- Scheduled jobs support on Linux/macOS/Windows (cron active on Linux)

---

## ⚠️ Known Constraints

1. LinkedIn direct message monitoring is not supported for standard app access (requires LinkedIn Partner Program).
2. Gmail MCP auth can drift/fail independently of local Gmail API token validity; startup preflight now detects this early, but runtime re-auth may still be required.
3. Windows Task Scheduler flow is not yet re-validated after Linux-side scheduler fixes (cron is validated and active).

---

## 📋 Next Steps (Prioritized)

### Immediate (2026-04-20 onward)
1. **Keep Gmail MCP startup preflight mandatory (no bypass)**
   - Treat startup as failed if preflight fails; do not run automation until healthy preflight.
2. **Publish incident runbook for transient Gmail MCP auth-refresh failures**
   - Include triage order: direct `gmail_get_profile` check → DNS/HTTPS/proxy checks → restart validation.
   - Include fallback re-auth/reset steps only after transport/session checks.
3. **Add bounded retry/backoff in Gmail MCP preflight check**
   - Reduce false startup aborts from short-lived token-endpoint/network blips.
4. **Run one strict HITL sensitive-email E2E drill after preflight pass**
   - Gmail input → `Pending_Approval` → `Approved` → MCP execution.
   - Verify real Gmail side effects (mark read/archive/reply) and matching Done artifacts.
5. **Stabilize `Needs_Action` drain behavior for important/uncertain emails**
   - Decide explicit policy: keep in `Needs_Action`, auto-route to `Pending_Approval`, or trigger manual-review task generation.
   - Prevent repeated "auto-processing completed" loops with unchanged review-only email set.
6. **Dashboard truthfulness hardening (action-level audit trail)**
   - Add per-item action trace (file name + action taken + destination folder) in Recent Activity.
   - Surface MCP final execution outcomes from `Done/EXECUTED_MCP_*.json` separately from queue-time counts.
7. **Validate live dashboard updates end-to-end after watcher restart**
   - Confirm updates appear when files enter `Needs_Action`, `Approved`, and when results land in `Done`.
   - Confirm new orchestrator counters match real folder transitions.

### Follow-up
1. **LinkedIn regression checks**
   - Add/maintain tests for auth exchange path (including no-`code_verifier` fallback behavior).
   - Add smoke test for token refresh behavior in long-running flow.

2. **Cleanup + hardening**
   - Remove temporary auth artifacts (e.g., `credentials/linkedin_pkce_verifier.txt`) after confirmation.

3. **Windows scheduler parity check**
   - Re-validate `scripts/setup_task_scheduler.ps1` execution path after payload updates.

4. **Documentation maintenance**
   - Update docs to include project-level Gmail MCP setup/auth path caveat and verification commands.
   - Keep API-first LinkedIn guidance consistent across quickstart/testing/reference docs.
   - Ensure startup docs reference watcher_manager-based `start.sh`/`stop.sh` behavior.
